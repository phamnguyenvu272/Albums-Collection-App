# java-albums-collection-app
This is a team-base project. Each team member contributed with different methods and code ideas in general.

The Album Collection App is a program that allows users to save information of the albums they own. The information saved include the album's name, current price, release year, genre, and the name of the artist.

The program reads the information from a text file, sorts it, and displays it in the UI. The collection can be sort by : the album's name, the artist name, the album's price, or the release year.

The Album Collection App displays statistics on the current collection. The statistics gather album's data based on their released year, their genre, and the artist.

This project was a final school project.
